    "The data came in a zip folder from <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/mortality\">kaggle.</a>  There were 11 CSVs that were millions of rows by 77 columns.  To get it into a format that can be worked with, a batch at a time were read into multiple dataframes, those dataframes were appended to each other, a sample was taken, and then the process was repeated with a second batch of CSVs.  The two sample CSVs were then appended to each other.  The reason for doing this in sections was because the dataframes were so large they were eating up too much memory.  The next three code blocks show that process.\n",

    "## This is a good example where using a plt.stackplot line chart vs. a conventional plt.plot line chart is very helpful.  Using a plt.plot produces 9 separate lines, the majority of which are close together and it’s very difficult to differentiate and make determinations.  In this case, the stockplot makes a great deal of sense, showing the relative percentage of the parts vs. the whole, in this case suicide deaths by education category.  You  can see that the grey area (HS or GED) is the largest contributor to an increasing number of suicides, followed by the ‘some college’ category, and ‘bachelor’s’ and ‘9th - 12th’ are not too far behind.  However, note that this is a sub-set of our df, filtering on deaths by suicide.\n",
    "## As the population grows the amount of deaths per year will also grow. As for education level, it is reported that 90% of the population 25 and older have earned a High School Degree. While only 28% over the age of 27 have college degrees. This means that the pool of \"High School level education or GED\" will be much larger than most, if not all, other education groups (it was by far in our data set: 400K/41% vs. 123k/13% ‘8th gr or less’). It is more appropriate to analyse this by percentage. The graph shows suicide deaths as a percentage of total deaths by year per education group.  A bit more difficult to see above, but the ‘Associates’ cat about doubled from 2005 to %2015 (1%-2%)\n",
    "## Overall \"Some College\" is the educational group with the highest percentage suicides of total deaths.  Counter-intuitively, the highest suicide rates were all higher education levels:  Some college: 2.26%, Associates: 1.95%, Doctorate: 1.93%, Bachelor's: 1.92%, Master's: 1.72%. In line with this relationship, the lowest level of education completed expressed in numbers and percentage of whole, was 8th grade or less."

What’s interesting to point out male suicide skyrockets 241% from 11-15 age group to 16-20 age group and jumps another 28.61% for 21-25, but by comparison, female suicides only jumps 111.24% from 11-15 age group to 16-20, which again is around half that of males.

It would be interesting to do further investigation to see how long the individual was a widow before passing away. The other groups have a fairly normal distribution and the peak seems to fall around the mid-life crisis time frame. Recalling from suicides by sex and age, we saw there was a spike for the number of men in their 20s; it seems the majority of these men were never married. Further investigation would be needed to do a correlation, but it’s safe to assume there is some sort of relationship.\n",
